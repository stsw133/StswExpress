/// Changes for future:
// TODO - animations (so Hubert can be satisfied)
// TODO - performance tests (application that uses this library should work fast and effective)
// TODO - export IEnumerable<T> to Excel
// TODO - fullscreen mode in StswWindow (hiding TitleBar and TaskBar)
// TODO - MessageBox and NotifyIcon builded in window
// TODO - new Stsw column controls
// TODO - new custom Calendar, ColorPicker, Expander, GroupBox, PasswordBox, RadioButton, ScrollViewer, DatePicker & TimePicker, ToggleSwitch, grid with dynamic number of rows or columns
// TODO - StswDataGrid with row offset loading (for example 50 rows from database per scroll down by indexer list - IDs downloaded with refresh function)
// TODO - possibility to move TitleBar from StswWindow to StswNavigation
// TODO - StswToggleButton with third state and better looking

/// Changes difficult to implement so have lower priority for now:
// TODO - StswDataGrid with special column - this option is ready, just needs some improvements
// TODO - Popup instead of ContextMenu in StswWindow but both of them are bugged anyway
// TODO - null filter in StswColumnFilter should completely hide filter field
// TODO - new option in StswColumnFilters to download or not data from database
// TODO - ExtCollection with RowState functionality (want to know which instances were modified/added/deleted before changing them in database)

/// Changes to do for now:
// TODO - edit instance from instances list with basic binding in context
// TODO - change all Stsw controls to use templates (left at the moment: StswDataGrid)
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs to refresh data on Enter click
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs template improvements (there is so much unnecessary code behind)
// TODO - StswNavigationButton should work with Expanders (something like sub buttons)
// TODO - StswNavigation with special button to hide section names or/and always hiding names and showing them only when mouse is over them
