/// Changes for future:
// TODO - animations (so Hubert can be satisfied)
// TODO - performance tests (application that uses this library should work fast and effective)
// TODO - MessageBox and NotifyIcon builded in window
// TODO - new custom Clock, ColorPicker, RatingControl, ScrollViewer, ToggleSwitch
// TODO - new custom Grid with dynamic number of rows or columns with auto height and width
// TODO - StswDataGrid with row offset loading (for example 50 rows from database per scroll down by indexer list - IDs downloaded with refresh function)
// TODO - StswDataGrid should have its own auto generated columns

/// Changes difficult to implement so have lower priority for now:
// TODO - null filter in StswColumnFilter should completely hide filter field
// TODO - new option in StswColumnFilters to download or not data from database
// TODO - ExtCollection with RowState functionality - this is ready, just needs some improvements

/// Changes to do for now:
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs to refresh data on Enter click
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs template improvements (there is so much unnecessary code behind)
