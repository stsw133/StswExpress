/// Changes for future:
// TODO - animations (so Hubert can be satisfied)
// TODO - performance tests (application that uses this library should work fast and effective)
// TODO - MessageBox and NotifyIcon builded in window
// TODO - new Stsw data grid column controls
// TODO - new custom Calendar, ColorPicker, Expander, GroupBox, PasswordBox, RadioButton, ScrollViewer, DatePicker & TimePicker, ToggleSwitch
// TODO - new custom Grid with dynamic number of rows or columns with auto height and width
// TODO - StswDataGrid with row offset loading (for example 50 rows from database per scroll down by indexer list - IDs downloaded with refresh function)
// TODO - StswToggleButton with third state and better looking (StswToggleSwitch propably will work this way)
// TODO - StswProgressBar could show different colors at the same time when there was some error but process was still going
			(then ProgressBar should be by default green and some parts inside red)

/// Changes difficult to implement so have lower priority for now:
// TODO - null filter in StswColumnFilter should completely hide filter field
// TODO - new option in StswColumnFilters to download or not data from database
// TODO - ExtCollection with RowState functionality - this is ready, just needs some improvements

/// Changes to do for now:
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs to refresh data on Enter click
// TODO - StswColumnFilter needs template improvements (there is so much unnecessary code behind)
// TODO - StswNavigationButton should work with Expanders (something like sub buttons)
